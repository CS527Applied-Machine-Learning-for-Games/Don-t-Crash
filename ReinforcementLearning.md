# Reinforcement Learning


Machine learning is a process whereby a computer program learns from experience to improve its performance at a specified task. ML algorithms are often classified under one of three broad categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). In the RL paradigm, an autonomous agent learns to improve its performance at an assigned task by interacting with its environment. Reinforcement learning requires an environment where state-action pairs can be recovered while modelling dynamics of the vehicle state, environment as well as the stochasticity in the movement and actions of the environment and agent respectively.

# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine learning where the autonomous agent learns from trial and error by attempting to maximize cumulative rewards over time. In the RL paradigm, the agent learns to improve its performance at an assigned task by interacting with its environment. Reinforcement learning requires an environment where state-action pairs can be recovered while modelling dynamics of the vehicle state, environment as well as the stochasticity in the movement and actions of the environment and agent respectively.
